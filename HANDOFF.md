# OpenForge — Handoff for the Next Agent

This file is the onboarding doc for an AI agent (or human) continuing work on
**OpenForge**, a clean-room, open-source, cross-platform 3D modeler written in
Rust. Read it fully before touching code.

---

## 1. What this project is

OpenForge is an original 3D modeler **inspired by** (not a clone of) ZModeler3,
which was analyzed with the REA tool (`npx rea-agents@latest setup`) to learn its
*architecture* (a plugin host with 23 services, 9 tool plugins, 15 format
filters, native `.z3d` format) — **not** to copy any code.

It is a growing feature-by-feature reimplementation. The engine layer is largely
complete; the remaining work is mostly application surface (GUI, GPU viewport,
interactive editors) and the plugin host.

## 2. HARD CONSTRAINTS — do not violate

- **Clean-room only.** Never decompile, reverse, or bypass the `zmStoneGuard.dll`
  DRM. Never copy proprietary ZModeler code. Inspiration from public behavior/
  architecture is fine; transliterating protected code is not.
- **Standard formats only.** Support OBJ, glTF/GLB, PLY, STL (and other open
  formats). Do **not** implement the proprietary `.z3d` format.
- **Cross-platform.** Must build and test on Windows, macOS, and Linux. CI runs
  all three.
- Push to `https://github.com/omarjson/OpenForge.git` (private repo, default
  branch `main`).

## 3. Environment setup (macOS host)

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"   # rustup / cargo / rustc (Rust 1.99.0)
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"          # gh CLI (v2.102.0), already authed as omarjson
```

- Working dir: `/Users/omar/Documents/zm/openforge`
- Shell is `zsh`: **never** use `$status` as a variable name (it's reserved).
- CI: `gh run list --repo omarjson/OpenForge`; each run is ~3–5 min across 7
  jobs. Watch with `gh run watch <id> --repo omarjson/OpenForge --exit-status`.

## 4. Repo layout — 11 crates (285 tests total, all green)

| Crate | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `openforge-core` | 22 | `Mesh`, `Scene`, nodes, selection, undo, tools. The data model. |
| `openforge-io` | 13 | Import/export: OBJ, glTF/GLB, PLY, STL. |
| `openforge-ops` | 17 | `MeshOps` extension trait: bevel, bridge, mirror, triangulate, flip, delete_edges, edge_loops, ring, **taper/twist/bend deformers**. |
| `openforge-materials` | 27 | Phong/Lambert materials, colors. |
| `openforge-render` | 51 | Camera/vertex/uniform plumbing **plus the wgpu viewport backend** (`gpu` feature): offscreen color+depth target, scene/grid/gizmo pipelines, frame stats. |
| `openforge-animation` | 51 | Keyframe tracks, interpolation, clips, player. |
| `openforge-algorithms` | 24 | Primitives, Catmull-Clark, Perlin/fBm noise, L-systems. |
| `openforge-uv` | 37 | Planar/cylindrical/spherical/box projections, unwrap, pack, plus per-selection affine edits for the UV editor. |
| `openforge-boolean` | 9 | BSP CSG: union/subtract/intersect, watertight output, volume/watertight checks. |
| `openforge-rig` | 22 | Skeletal rigging + linear-blend skinning: bones, hierarchy, bind/pose, `SkinWeights`, `skin_mesh`. |
| `openforge-app` | 12 (bin) | eframe/egui GUI. `app.rs` (~1900 lines) + `viewport.rs` (CPU painter + picking) + `gpu_viewport.rs` (wgpu bridge) + `uv_editor.rs` (UV panel). |

## 5. Architecture & conventions (follow these exactly)

- **Extension traits, one impl per type-pair.** Rust allows only ONE
  `impl Trait for Type` per pair. Ops like `MeshOps` (openforge-ops) and `UvOps`
  (openforge-uv) are implemented for core's `Mesh` from *separate* crates. Their
  method bodies live as `pub(crate)` free functions + a single delegating impl
  block. Do not split into multiple `impl MeshOps for Mesh` blocks.
- **No inherent `impl` on foreign types.** You cannot write `impl Mesh { ... }`
  outside openforge-core. Use free functions or an extension trait.
- **Undo is snapshot-based.** `Scene::clone()` before/after; `Scene::content_eq`
  decides whether to record. In the app, wrap edits in
  `self.with_edit(label, |app| { ... })`. Live/previews (e.g. a slider dragging)
  should mutate directly **without** `with_edit` to avoid flooding the undo stack.
- **The viewport has two paths, picked at runtime.** When eframe runs its
  `wgpu` backend the app renders through `openforge-render`'s `gpu` feature:
  `gpu_viewport.rs` sizes/owns the offscreen target, registers its texture with
  egui and draws it via `painter.image`. With no GPU device the app falls back
  to the CPU painter in `viewport.rs`. Both share one camera state (`Camera`),
  bridged by `gpu_viewport::orbit_camera`; picking is always CPU-side because
  NDC math is identical for either path.
- **Colour space matters.** The offscreen target must be `Rgba8UnormSrgb` (the
  only format `egui_wgpu` accepts for native textures) and the shaders write
  *linear* colour. Anything authored as sRGB bytes must go through
  `openforge_render::gpu::linear_from_srgb_u8`; clear colours likewise.
- **The UV editor is its own panel, not a viewport mode** (`uv_editor.rs` owns
  the canvas math and panel state, `app.rs` owns the wiring). See §8 for its
  gotchas: canvas rect construction, the placeholder UV slot, and one undo entry
  per drag.
- **Bottom-panel order is load-bearing.** Add the status bar first, then other
  bottom panels, then the side panels, and the central viewport last: that is
  what keeps the viewport's rect clear of the panels below it.
- **`wgpu` is pinned once**, in `[workspace.dependencies]`, and must stay in
  lockstep with the wgpu eframe re-exports — otherwise the device/texture types
  crossing between eframe and `openforge-render` stop being the same types.
- **`.cargo/config.toml` sets `future-incompat-report.frequency = "never"`.**
  wgpu's Metal backend pulls in `block v0.1.6`, whose notice Cargo prints as a
  `warning:` line and would otherwise break the zero-warning bar. Inspect it
  again with `cargo report future-incompatibilities`.
- **Tests use an atomic-counter temp dir** helper where temp files are needed, to
  survive parallel `cargo test`.
- **Zero warnings is the bar.** `cargo build --workspace 2>&1 | grep -c warning`
  must be `0`. Run clippy-level clean code; no `#[allow]` unless justified.
- **The app's `app.rs` pattern for wiring a new engine:**
  1. Add crate dep to `crates/openforge-app/Cargo.toml`.
  2. Import it in `app.rs`.
  3. Add command methods (`fn *_selected(&mut self, ...)`) near the other
     commands, using `with_edit` for committed edits.
  4. Add a toolbar row in `handle_top_toolbar` (see Deform/Boolean/Rig rows).
  5. `cargo build -p openforge-app` until clean, then full workspace + CI.

## 6. Definition of done (for every change)

1. `cargo build --workspace` → **0 warnings**.
2. `cargo test --workspace` → **all pass, 0 failures**.
3. `git add -A && git commit` with a descriptive message; `git push origin main`.
4. Confirm CI green: **all 7 jobs** on Windows/macOS/Linux.
5. For a new crate: add to workspace `members` in the root `Cargo.toml` and give
   it tests (aim for 10–25 meaningful tests).

## 7. Current state & what's next

**State:** baseline commit `2a201c8`. Full workspace builds with **0 warnings**,
**285 tests pass**, CI green on all 3 platforms. This session took two
work-streams to done — the **wgpu viewport** (#1) and the **interactive UV
editor** (#2) — and added a progress report:

- **`scripts/progress.sh`** draws a progress bar per parity area and can
  rewrite [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) (`--write`). It keeps *measured* counts
  (crates, test fns, lines of Rust) separate from *curated* per-area scores,
  because parity has no machine-checkable definition. Run it after every
  work-stream and re-score the area you touched.

- **`openforge-render` grew a real GPU backend** behind the `gpu` feature.
  `gpu::GpuRenderer` builds pipelines from the existing WGSL, keeps a growable
  scene vertex/index buffer, writes per-frame uniforms, and draws into an
  offscreen `Rgba8UnormSrgb` target **with a `Depth32Float` depth buffer** — the
  depth test replaces the old painter's-algorithm sort. It draws three passes:
  the ground grid (depth-tested, no depth write, so meshes always composite over
  it), the scene (depth test *and* write), and a corner axis gizmo using a
  rotation-only ortho camera that always draws on top.
- **The app presents that image through egui** (`gpu_viewport.rs`) and keeps the
  CPU painter as a fallback when no GPU device exists. Selection highlight comes
  from the per-vertex colours `MeshBuffers::build_scene` already produced.
- **19 new tests**: 16 in `openforge-render` (pure sRGB/grid/gizmo/viewport
  helpers, `MeshBuffers::append`, plus an adapter-guarded **headless GPU smoke
  test** that renders offscreen and reads pixels back) and 3 in `openforge-app`
  (format/rounding/camera-bridge). The WGSL is also validated with **naga** in a
  test that needs no GPU, so CI checks shader correctness on GPU-less runners.
- `.cargo/config.toml` and one `lsystem.rs` test rename keep both the build and
  the test build warning-free.
- **A working interactive UV editor.** `openforge-uv` gained per-selection ops —
  `uv_transform_selected` (scale, then rotate about a pivot, then translate),
  `uv_face_uvs` and `uv_bounds_selected` — because the existing `UvOps` could
  only transform *every* UV. `openforge-app` gained `uv_editor.rs` (canvas math
  + panel state + drawing) and an `app.rs` panel: a 2D canvas with the `0..1`
  tile, a quarter grid, the UV wireframe and a dot per UV; click and
  rubber-band selection (Shift adds); drag to move (one undo entry per drag);
  and buttons for the six projections, Normalize, Flip V, Pack (grid 1..8) and
  a scale/rotate transform about the selection's centre.
- **15 more tests** (6 in `openforge-uv`, 9 in `openforge-app`), all pure: the
  affine selection maths and subset queries, plus the canvas mapping, picking,
  band selection and selection-retarget rules.

**Verified this session:** `cargo build --workspace` → 0 warnings;
`cargo test --workspace` → 285 pass; `cargo build --release -p openforge-app`
(the CI build job) succeeds; `cargo clippy` reports nothing in
`openforge-render`, `openforge-uv` or `openforge-app`; the app was launched
locally and logged `eframe: ... Using wgpu.` with a Metal adapter and **no**
`egui_wgpu` warnings. The UV panel was exercised by temporarily opening it with
a mesh selected and tracing its canvas rect: it drew for 82 frames as a 300x300
square directly above the status bar, with no panic.
**Not verified:** how the window actually looks, and the UV canvas by eye — the
agent has no display access, so a human should look at both once.

**Progress toward full ZModeler parity: see [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md)** for
the per-area bars (`scripts/progress.sh --write` regenerates it). The engine
layer is essentially done, and the two largest application-surface gaps — the
GPU viewport and the UV editor — now have real implementations. Prioritized
next steps:

1. **Deepen the GPU viewport** (best next value). It renders shaded geometry;
   the editor surface around it is still missing — GPU selection outlines and
   wireframe, MSAA, a materials-driven shader instead of the single hard-coded
   Lambert pass, and depth-buffer picking so sub-object picking matches exactly
   what is drawn. All additive to `GpuRenderer`.
2. **Deepen the UV editor.** No texture background yet, no island-level ops
   (weld/split/mirror), no snapping, and the 3D face selection is pushed into
   the UV selection on demand rather than staying in sync.
3. **Plugin/service host.** ZModeler's core idea: 23 services + pluggable tools.
   Design an `openforge-plugin` trait + registry so tools/formats become
   pluggable instead of hard-wired. This is the long road to true parity.
4. **IO expansion.** Add COLLADA/DAE, OFF, or ASCII FBX (open subsets) to widen
   format coverage beyond the current 4.
5. **Materials node editor.** Replace basic Phong/Lambert with a node graph.

**Honest gap to parity:** game-specific tooling (vehicles, LOD, dummies/TXD),
the full panel/dialog surface, and exact format breadth remain the largest
deltas and are many work-streams, not one push.

## 8. Known gotchas when using AI subagents here

- **Free-model concurrency cap.** Running multiple subagents in parallel stalls
  them (they choke on the shared model). **Run ONE subagent at a time.** A single
  background agent works but is slow to report — it is usually *working*, not
  stuck.
- **Always verify a subagent's output on disk** (`cargo test -p <crate>`,
  warnings check) before trusting its summary. It may have left compile errors.
- **Large-file writes can time out** (the `write` tool / single-shot shell). For
  big files, write in chunks or use a shell heredoc (`cat > file <<'EOF'`).
- **The wgpu viewport breaks in three easy-to-hit ways.** (a) Read the egui
  texture id *after* `GpuViewport::render` — it re-registers the texture on
  resize, and a stale id logs `egui_wgpu ... Missing texture: User(n)`. (b) wgpu
  rejects a viewport/scissor rect that overflows the attachment; use
  `gpu::gizmo_viewport`, which clamps to fit. (c) Author sRGB colours, not raw
  linear bytes, or the image is washed out.
- **eframe picks its backend from `renderer: eframe::Renderer::Wgpu`** in
  `main.rs`. eframe's default features still include `glow`, so without that line
  the GPU path would silently never activate and the app would quietly stay on
  the CPU fallback. (`glow` could be dropped from `eframe` to trim CI/build
  time; the defaults are kept for safety.)
- **The UV editor is its own panel, not a viewport mode.** `uv_editor.rs`
  owns the canvas math (`v` grows *upward*; UV↔canvas mapping, picking, rubber
  band) and the panel state; `app.rs` owns the wiring and pushes committed
  edits through `with_edit`. A live drag mutates directly and pushes **one**
  undo entry on release, the same rule the 3D transforms follow.
- **Panel order in `update()` matters.** The status bar is added first so it
  owns the bottom edge, then the UV editor, then the side panels, and the
  central viewport last. That is what keeps the viewport's rect — and its mouse
  input — clear of the bottom panels.
- **An unprojected mesh still has one UV slot.** `Mesh::ensure_attributes`
  installs a placeholder `Vec2::ZERO` so corner indices stay valid, so "has real
  UVs" is `uvs.len() > 1`, not `> 0`.
- **Use `egui::Rect::from_two_pos`, not `from_min_max`, for canvas rects.**
  `from_min_max` is a raw constructor that does *not* normalize; feeding it
  bottom-left/top-right (which is what a `v`-up canvas produces) yields an
  inverted rect with a negative height.
- **Build a `GpuRenderer` from the device eframe hands you**
  (`cc.wgpu_render_state` / `frame.wgpu_render_state()`), not from a wgpu
  `Instance` of your own. The headless test is the one place that creates its
  own instance, and it must skip gracefully when no adapter exists.
- **`scene.get()` returns `Result`** (not `Option`) — use `.ok()` / `if let Ok`.
- **`selection.selected_nodes()`** yields `NodeId` by value; in `.filter(|id|)`
  the binding is `&NodeId`, so deref with `*id` (not `**id`).

*When you finish a work-stream, update §7 (state + progress) and this file so the
next agent inherits an accurate picture.*
